## Overview

It was an unique experience working on this project...my first "dark mode" website using GoT theme. Beside its simplicity, it was fun using CSS Variables.

### The Challenge

The project was divided in three parts:
- First HTML structure, creating an input linked to the label;
- Second the CSS, almost everything is declared there, within variables...
- Last one, the JavaSctipt content was very simple...just acessed a tag component and changed its class.

## My Process
### Technologies
- HTML5 (semantics)
- CSS3 (Variables)
- JavaScript (Element DOM)

### What I learned
I learned that each website should have a dark mode.

### Final Project
